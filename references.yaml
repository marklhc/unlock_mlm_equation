    Cross-level interaction effects lay at the heart of multilevel contingency
    and interactionism theories. Also, practitioners are particularly interested
    in such effects because they provide information on the contextual
    conditions and processes under which interventions focused on individuals
    (e.g., selection, leadership training, performance appraisal, and
    management) result in more or less positive outcomes. We derive a new
    intraclass correlation, ρ
                  β
                  , to assess the degree of lower-level outcome variance that is attributed to higher-level differences in slope coefficients. We provide analytical and empirical evidence that ρ
                  β
                  is an index of variance that differs from the traditional intraclass correlation ρ
                  α
                  and use data from recently published articles to illustrate that ρ
                  α
                  assesses differences across collectives and higher-level processes (e.g., teams, leadership styles, reward systems) but ignores the variance attributed to differences in lower-level relationships (e.g., individual level job satisfaction and individual level performance). Because ρ
                  α
                  and ρ
                  β
                  provide information on two different sources of variability in the data structure (i.e., differences in means and differences in relationships, respectively), our results suggest that researchers contemplating the use of multilevel modeling, as well those who suspect nonindependence in their data structure, should expand the decision criteria for using multilevel approaches to include both types of intraclass correlations. To facilitate this process, we offer an illustrative data set and the icc beta R package for computing ρ
                  β
                  in single- and multiple-predictor situations and make them available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (i.e., CRAN).

                        Nakagawa & Schielzeth extended the widely used goodness‐of‐fit statistic

                        to apply to generalized linear mixed models (
                        GLMM
                        s). However, their
                        R

                        method is restricted to models with the simplest random effects structure, known as random intercepts models. It is not applicable to another common random effects structure, random slopes models.

                        can be extended to random slopes models using a simple formula that is straightforward to implement in statistical software. This extension substantially widens the potential application of

    Multilevel modeling techniques are becoming more popular in handling data
    with multilevel structure in educational and behavioral research. Recently,
    researchers have paid more attention to cross-classified data structure that
    naturally arises in educational settings. However, unlike traditional
    single-level research, methodological studies about multilevel effect size
    have been rare and those that have recently appeared had an emphasis on
    strictly hierarchical data structure. This article extends the work on
    multilevel standardized mean differences from strictly hierarchical
    structure to both fully and partially cross-classified structures.
    Analytically derived formulae for calculating effect sizes and the
    corresponding sampling variances (or standard errors) are presented,
    verified by simulation results, and illustrated with real data examples.
    Implications for primary research studies and meta-analyses are discussed.

    Previous studies have detailed the consequence of ignoring a level of
    clustering in multilevel models with straightly hierarchical structures and
    have proposed methods to adjust for the fixed effect standard errors ( SEs).
    However, in behavioral and social science research, there are usually two or
    more crossed clustering levels, such as when students are cross-classified
    by schools and neighborhoods, yet it is not uncommon that researchers focus
    only on one level of clustering. Using the generalized least squares
    framework, in this study, we derive the bias in the fixed effect SE
    estimators when one crossed random effect is omitted. We then showed, using
    data from the Scotland Neighborhood Study, how one can correct for the SEs
    and obtain corrected statistical inference when a misspecified two-level
    model was used in a primary study, which is useful when evaluating
    observational studies or cluster randomized trials that ignored a crossed
    random effects or when conducting meta-analyses. In addition, our analytic
    results provide theoretical insights on how one can quantify imbalance with
    cross-classified data by the strength of association between the two-crossed
    random effects in a contingency table and how the degree of imbalance
    relates to the correction factor for the fixed effect SEs.

    Multilevel modeling is often used to analyze survey data collected with a
    multistage sampling design. When the selection is informative, sampling
    weights need to be incorporated in the estimation. We propose a weighted
    residual bootstrap method as an alternative to the multilevel pseudo-maximum
    likelihood (MPML) estimators. In a Monte Carlo simulation using two-level
    linear mixed effects models, the bootstrap method showed advantages over
    MPML for the estimates and the statistical inferences of the intercept, the
    slope of the level-2 predictor, and the variance components at level-2. The
    impact of sample size, selection mechanism, intraclass correlation (ICC),
    and distributional assumptions on the performance of the methods were
    examined. The performance of MPML was suboptimal when sample size and ICC
    were small and when the normality assumption was violated. The bootstrap
    estimates performed generally well across all the simulation conditions, but
    had notably suboptimal performance in estimating the covariance component in
    a random slopes model when sample size and ICCs were large. As an
    illustration, the bootstrap method is applied to the American data of the
    OECD’s Program for International Students Assessment (PISA) survey on math
    achievement using the R package bootmlm.

    The hierarchical linear model approach to a two-level design is considered,
    some variables at the lower level having fixed and others having random
    regression coefficients. An approximation is derived to the covariance
    matrix of the estimators of the fixed regression coefficients (for variables
    at the lower and the higher level) under the assumption that the sample
    sizes at either level are large enough. This covariance matrix is expressed
    as a function of parameters occurring in the model. If a research planner
    can make a reasonable guess as to these parameters, this approximation can
    be used as a guide to the choice of sample sizes at either level.

                  Multilevel modeling (MLM) is commonly used in psychological research to model clustered data. However, data in applied research usually violate one of the essential assumptions of MLM—homogeneity of variance. While the fixed-effect estimates produced by the maximum likelihood method remain unbiased, the standard errors for the fixed effects are misestimated, resulting in inaccurate inferences and inflated or deflated type I error rates. To correct the bias in fixed effects standard errors and provide valid inferences, small-sample corrections such as the Kenward-Roger (KR) adjustment and the adjusted cluster-robust standard errors (CR-SEs) with the Satterthwaite approximation for
                  t
                  tests have been used. The current study compares KR with random slope (RS) models and the adjusted CR-SEs with ordinary least squares (OLS), random intercept (RI) and RS models to analyze small, heteroscedastic, clustered data using a Monte Carlo simulation. Results show the KR procedure with RS models has large biases and inflated type I error rates for between-cluster effects in the presence of level 2 heteroscedasticity. In contrast, the adjusted CR-SEs generally yield results with acceptable biases and maintain type I error rates close to the nominal level for all examined models. Thus, when the interest is only in within-cluster effect, any model with the adjusted CR-SEs could be used. However, when the interest is to make accurate inferences of the between-cluster effect, researchers should use the adjusted CR-SEs with RS to have higher power and guard against unmodeled heterogeneity. We reanalyzed an example in Snijders & Bosker (2012) to demonstrate the use of the adjusted CR-SEs with different models.
